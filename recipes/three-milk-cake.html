<br> 
<h1>    ◎ Ingredients</h1>

<ul>
<li > 6 eggs, separated   </li>
<li > 1 cup white sugar  </li>
<li > 1 cup all-purpose flour   </li>
<li > 1 tablespoon baking powder   </li>
<li > ½ cup milk   </li>
<li > 2 teaspoons vanilla extract   </li>
<li > 1 cup heavy whipping cream (Optional)   </li>
<li > 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk   </li>
<li > 1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk   </li>
<li > 1 cup whipped cream (Optional)   </li>
<li > 1 cup sliced fresh strawberries (Optional)   </li>
</ul>

<br> 

<h1>    ◎ Directions</h1>

<ol>

<li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).   </li>
<li> Grease a 10x15-inch baking dish.</li>
<li> Beat egg whites in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high until stiff peaks form; gradually beat in sugar until mixture is glossy. Beat in egg yolks, one at a time, combining each yolk before adding the next. Reduce mixer speed to medium and add flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time, to the mixture, beating continuously; beat in baking powder, milk, and vanilla extract. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.   </li>
<li> Bake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cake cool for 15 minutes.   </li>
<li> Pour 1 cup cream, sweetened condensed milk, and evaporated milk in a blender and pulse several times until well blended. Pour three-milk mixture evenly over the cake. Refrigerate cake until cold and the milk mixture has soaked in, at least 1 hour.   </li>
<li> Cut in squares and top each serving with a dollop of whipped cream and a few sliced strawberries. Refrigerate leftovers.   </li>

</ol>
